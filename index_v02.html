          <h3>Early Life</h3>
          <p class="paragraph_text">I have spent most of my time in an art studio. I have studied design and fine arts most of my early life. I can work in most art mediums. Not until high school I started to learn to use digitals medias. It was a challenge at first. Over time I have strayed away from the physical medias and have become focused of digital medias.</p>

          <h3>Currently</h3>
          <p class="paragraph_text"> I was accepted into Westphal College of Media Arts at Drexel University in 2016 for the Interactive Digital Media major. The work and skills I have had to learn were daunting especially because I have not had any prior education with computer languages. I chose Interactive Digital Media because of the wide skill set needed for the job environment in digital media. My ideal career is not to be in one position doing one job every day. I would like to explore many roles in many fields. Digital media stretches across many fields that will allow me to keep learning and make the best product for that client. I fit into the role of project manager or creative director for projects. </p>
